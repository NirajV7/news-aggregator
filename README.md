## 🚀 Installation

This project can be easily set up and run using Docker.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- [NewsAPI Key](https://newsapi.org/register)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NirajV7/news-aggregator.git
    cd news-aggregator
    ```

2.  **Create `.env` file with your NewsAPI Key:**
    In the root of the `news-aggregator` directory, create a new file named `.env` and add your NewsAPI key:
    ```
    NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_NEWSAPI_KEY
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_NEWSAPI_KEY` with the key you obtained from NewsAPI. This file is ignored by Git for security reasons and should not be committed to the repository.

3.  **Build and Run the Docker Containers:**
    From the root of the `news-aggregator` directory, run the following command. This will build the Docker images for both the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) services, and then start them.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command might take some time on the first run as it downloads all necessary dependencies.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
    You should now see the news aggregator application fully functional.

### Managing Docker Containers

-   **To stop the application:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running.
-   **To stop and remove containers/networks:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
-   **To run in detached mode (background):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
-   **To rebuild images (after code or dependency changes):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
